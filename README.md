I chose a datset from the national household education becuase I had looked at their datasets before and found the surveys and questions they were asking and gathering information on interesting. I've always wanted to know how different factors affect students' education. This dataset has questions about what different characteristics each students have in their life. I chose this column specifically because the characteristic/factor was about homeschooling and I've always found homeschooling intruiging. This column shows how many days a week each student was homeschooled. I learned how many days a week they were homeschooled. I can compare their other data and how the did well to school to other students' data knowing how many days they were homeschooled.
